# Covid-19 Tracker Project


In this project I have used free api to get the covid-19 data and show them with the help of HTML, CSS and JS. The free api provides the data of COVID-19 as per the country query.
The api link is here: https://corona.lmao.ninja/v2/countrie...
You can use postman and test the api.
I have used fetch in js to get the data from api.
